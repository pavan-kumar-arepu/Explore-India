			<key>description</key>
			<string>Leander Paes, (born June 17, 1973, Goa, India) Indian tennis player who was one of the most successful doubles players in tennis history, with eight career Grand Slam doubles titles and six career Grand Slam mixed doubles championships.
                
                
                
                Paes began playing tennis at the age of five, and in 1985 he joined a tennis academy in Madras (now Chennai). He won the 1990 Wimbledon junior title and was briefly ranked the number one junior player in the world. Paes joined the Indian Davis Cup team in 1990 and turned professional in 1991. In 1996 when he took the men’s singles tennis bronze medal at the Atlanta Olympic Games, he became the first Indian athlete since 1952 to win an individual Olympic medal.
                
                
                
                Paes began a doubles partnership with countryman Mahesh Bhupathi in 1994. In both 1997 and 1998, the duo captured six Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) doubles titles out of the eight tournament finals they reached during each year. Paes and Bhupathi advanced to the doubles finals of all four Grand Slam tournaments in 1999, winning the French Open and Wimbledon but losing in the Australian and U.S. Opens. That year saw the pair ascend to the number one ATP doubles ranking, but personal problems between them soon led to the dissolution of their full-time partnership. Paes and Bhupathi did play together on occasion over the following years, including at the 2001 French Open, which they won for the second time.
                
                
                
                Without Bhupathi, Paes continued his doubles success, winning five additional Grand Slam titles with a series of Czech partners: the 2006 U.S. Open (with Martin Damm), the 2009 French and U.S. Opens (both with Lukáš Dlouhý), and the 2012 Australian Open and the 2013 U.S. Open (both with Radek Štěpánek).

			<string>Kapil Dev</string>
			<key>description</key>
			<string>
                Kapil Dev made his first class debut in November 1975 at the age of 17, against the Punjab. He returned with a splendid performance taking 6 wickets for just 39 runs. There was no looking back after that as one splendid performance followed another. In his next few matches, Kapil destroyed the opposition (Jammu and Kashmir, Bengal and Services) with his lethal deliveries. This marked the arrival of one of the greatest cricketers of India and the day was not far off when Kapil would make it to the Indian team. That special day came in 1978, at Faisalabad, against Pakistan. He could not make big impression but this series saw the emergence of Kapil Dev as a talented fast bowler and all rounder.
                

                
                Kapil Dev - Kapil Dev Although cricket became popular during the British raj but it was largely because of two players that the game became a household name in India in 80&apos;s. These two were Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev. Kapil indeed ruled the minds and hearts of an entire generation in the 1980s and the one that followed. Till the rise of Kapil Dev, India was known for deadly spinners and his emergence coincided with the decline of the famous spin quartet of Bedi, Prasanna, Chandrasekhar and S. Venkataraghavan
                
                
                
                Kapil Dev was the greatest pace bowler India has produced, and their greatest fast-bowling all rounder. Such was the charisma and stamina of this man that at one point of time he became the highest wicket taker in test and one day cricket. Along with Imran Khan, Ian Botham and Richard Hadlee, Kapil Dev was considered the greatest all rounder of his times.</string>

			<string>Sachin Tendulkar</string>
			<key>description</key>
			<string> Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar was born on April 24, 1973 in Mumbai, India. He went to Shradashram Vidyamandir, a high school in Mumbai, where he began his cricketing career under his coach Ramakant Achrekar. He attended the MRF Pace Foundation during his schooldays to train as a fast bowler, but Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee, who saw him training, was not much impressed and suggested that Tendulkar should focus on his batting instead. As a young boy, Tendulkar would practice for hours at the net, and was driven hard by his coach Achrekar.
                
                
                While at school, his extraordinary batting skills got noticed by the sports circuit. People felt that the young boy would soon become one of the greats in cricket. In the 1988 season, he scored a century in every inning that he played. In one of the inter school matches that year, he had an unbroken 664-run partnership with friend and team mate Vinod Kambli.
            
            When he was 14, Indian batting legend Sunil Gavaskar a great Indian batsman of that time, gave him a pair of his own light pads. This touching gesture greatly encouraged the budding cricketer, who 20 years later broke Gavaskar’s world record of 34 Test centuries.
            
            
            In 1988, when he was just under 16, he scored 100 not out in for Bombay against Gujrat. This was on his first-class debut. He then scored a century in his first appearance in the Deodhar and Duleep Trophy. Mumbai captain Dilip Vengsarkar picked him up after seeing him batting Kapil Dev in the nets. That season he was Bombay’s highest run-getter. In the Irani Trophy final, He made an unbeaten century. He scored a century in all three of his Irani Trophy, Ranji Trophy and Duleep Trophy debuts, and became the first player to do so. He was selected for the tour of Pakistan next year.
                At the very young age of 16, Sachin played his first Test match against Pakistan in Karachi in 1989. In this Test, he received several blows to his body at the hands of Waqar Younis, a pace bowler. He made just 15 runs. In the last test in Sialkot, he had a bloody nose from a bouncer, but he went on playing. He scored better in the subsequent games, scoring 53 runs of 18 balls at Peshawar.</string>

			<string>Sunil Gavaskar</string>
			<key>description</key>
			<string>Sunil Gavaskar, in full Sunil Manohar Gavaskar, bynames Sunny and the Little Master (born July 10, 1949, Bombay [now Mumbai], India) Indian cricket player who is considered one of the sport’s greatest opening batsmen of all time. Gavaskar skillfully captained the Indian team in 47 Test (international) matches and dominated the game during a career that spanned 16 years and 125 total Test contests.
                
                
                Gavaskar was instigated into playing cricket in Bombay under the guidance of his Test-playing uncle, Madhav Mantri. Gavaskar’s impressive performance in domestic cricket soon attracted national notice, and he was selected for the extremely tough tour of the West Indies in 1971. Not only on that tour—when he scored 774 runs—but also in subsequent tours, Gavaskar was the one batsman the fearsome West Indian bowlers could never suppress. His world record of 34 Test centuries (100 runs in a single innings) stood for 19 years until it was broken by his countryman Sachin Tendulkar in 2005. Just 5 feet 5 inches (1.65 metres) tall, Gavaskar was a master of short-pitched bowling; very few fast bowlers could claim to have completely dominated him.
                
                
                Gavaskar went on to break many records, setting his own long-standing Indian Test record of 236 not out (subsequently broken by Tendulkar). He is also the only Indian to have scored two centuries in a Test match on three occasions. A superb driver and cutter of the ball, Gavaskar was the first player to score 10,000 runs in Test matches.

			<string>Mohammed Rafi</string>
			<key>description</key>
			<string>One of the greatest playback singers of India, Mohammed Rafi is considered no less than a genius when it comes to varied styles of music. Born on December 24th, 1924, this great soul had the perfect blend of melody, emotions and energy, which reflected greatly in his songs. Be it the classically inclined songs of Baiju Bawara or the foot tapping songs of Kashmir Ki Kali, Muhammad Rafi gave each song the treatment it deserved. His contribution to the Hindi film industry has been fabulous and perhaps no singer till date has managed to capture the hearts of fans the way Mohamed Rafi has. We capture the fascinating life history of Rafi in this short biography of Mohd. Rafi.
                
                
                Muhammad Rafi was born in Kotla Sultan Singh located near Amritsar in the then undivided Punjab. Rafi had five older brothers ad his father&apos;s name was Hajji Ali Mohammad. Lovingly addressed as Pheeko by his family, Rafi started showing his inclination towards music at a very early age when he used to imitate the chants of a wandering beggar in his village. In the year 1935, Rafi&apos;s family moved to Lahore. Rafi&apos;s love for music was recognized soon by his family and he was encouraged to pursue it further. Thus, Mohamed Rafi went on to seek training in Hindustani classical music from eminent personalities like Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, Ustad Abdul Wahid Khan, Pundit Jiwanlal Matto and Firoze Nizami.
                
                
                Rafi&apos;s first public performance was at the tender age of 13. One day Rafi along with his brother Hamid went to attend a performance by the renowned K.L. Saigal. But there was a power failure at the venue and the legendary singer refused to sing. When the audience began to lose patience, Rafi&apos;s brother Hamid requested the organizer to allow Rafi to keep the audience entertained till the power came back. He was allowed to do so and it turned out to be the correct exposure for him. Among the audience was seated the great composer Shyam Sunder who immediately recognized immense talent and untapped potential in Rafi. He invited Rafi to come to Bombay for a recording. From there on began the journey of the most versatile singer of India.
                
                In the year 1944, Mohammed Rafi recorded his first song under music director Shyam Sunder. It was for a Punjabi movie named Gul Baloch. It was recognized by many and Rafi started to get more and more offers. Rafi also sang songs composed by Naushad for the movie Pehle Aap in the year 1944. He also acted in a couple of movies named Laila Majnu (1945) and Jugnu (1947). Another splendid performance was in the year 1946 when he sang the song &quot;Tera Khilona Toota Balak&quot; of the movie Anmol Ghadi. With the movie Jugnu (1947), Rafi bagged his first major hit. The song &quot;Yahaan Badla Wafa Ka&apos;&apos; with Noor Jehan under Feroze Nizami went on to become a major hit with the public.</string>

			<string>Lata Mangeshkar</string>
			<key>description</key>
			<string>Lata Mangeshkar is one of the best singers of the Hindi film industry. She is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the most recorded artist in the world. It is estimated that she has more than 30,000 solo, duet and chorus backed songs in 20 different languages from 1948 to 1987. Now, it must way over 40,000! Lata Mangeshkar was born on 28th September, 1929 in a place called Indore. Her father Dinanath Mangeshkar was a renowned classical singer himself. Lata was introduced to music at a very young age. The life history of Lata Mangeshkar is truly fascinating. Read this short biography of Lata Mungeshkar.
                
                
                Lata Mangeshkar was very young when her father passed away, thus making the family dependant on Lata. To take care of her family&apos;s economic situation, Lata acted in as many as 8 films from 1942 to 1948. She debuted as playback singer in a Marathi film named Kiti Hasaal (1942). Unfortunately the song was edited out. Her first Hindi playback was for the film Aap ke Sewa Main (1947) but she did not get noticed. At that time, the film industry was ruled by female singers who had heavier and huskier voices like Noor Jehan, Shamshad Begum and Zohrabai Ambalewali. While auditioning for the movie Shaheed (1948), she was rejected on the account of her thin voice! But Ghulam Haider saw the potential in her and gave her a chance to sing in the film Majboor.
                
                
                The song Dil Mera Toda finally got her noticed and it was touted as her breakthrough song. In 1949, she had four major hits from the films Barsaat, Andaaz, Dulari and Mahal. The song &quot;Aayega Aanewala&quot; from Mahal was a huge hit and Lata secured a firm position in the industry. The husky voices of all other singers became obsolete in front of the high pitched voice of Lata Mangeshkar. The music industry had a huge makeover with the arrival of Lata Mangeshkar. By the late 50&apos;s, the younger sister of Lata Mangeshkar known as Asha Bhonsle also came into the scene and they both were touted as the unbeatable voices of the industry.
                
                
                Lata rose to fame rapidly and made her indelible mark in the industry. She has sung with famous singers like Mohammed Rafi, Kishore Kumar, Mukesh, etc. She has perfected almost every genre of music. Her success and determination made her one of the most powerful women in the industry. She refused to sing for the great composer S.D Burman due to some misunderstanding and also stopped singing with Mohammed Rafi. Her power was so immense that they had to come back to her. She actually monopolized the music industry and every music director wanted to work with her. She understood the requirement of each song and sang flawlessly.
                
                
                Lata Mangeshkar has been honored with innumerable awards but the one that truly deserves a special mention is that she is the only second singer in the non-classical category (after M.S Subbulakshmi) in India to have received the highest civilian award, Bharat Ratna. She has received three national awards and eight Filmfare awards after which she stopped accepting awards in order to promote new talent. She continues to sing every now and then for Hindi movies and perform live. Truly a living legend, Lata Mangeshkar has a talent that is second to none.</string>

			<string>Bhagat Singh</string>
			<key>description</key>
			<string>Bhagat Singh was born on 27 September 1907 at Banga in Lyallpur district (now Pakistan) to Kishan Singh and Vidya Vati. From his early childhood, Bhagat Singh was imbued with the family&apos;s spirit of patriotism. At the time of his birth, his father Kishan Singh was in jail. His uncle, Sardar Ajit Singh, was a great freedom fighter and established the Indian Patriots&apos; Association. He was well-supported by his friend Syed Haidar Raza, in organizing the peasants against the Chenab Canal Colony Bill. Ajit Singh had 22 cases against him and was forced to flee to Iran. Bhagat Singh was considered to be one of the most influential revolutionaries of Indian Nationalist Movement. He became involved with numerous revolutionary organizations.
                
                
                
                Kishan Singh enrolled Bhagat Singh in Dayanand Anglo Vedic High School. At a very young age, Bhagat Singh started following Non-Cooperation Movement called by Mahatma Gandhi. Bhagat Singh had openly defied the British and had followed Gandhi&apos;s wishes by burning the government-sponsored books. Following the violent incidents of &quot;Chauri Chaura&quot;, Gandhi called for the withdrawal of the Non-Cooperation movement. Unhappy with the decision, Bhagat Singh, isolated himself from Gandhi&apos;s nonviolent action and joined the Young Revolutionary Movement.
                
                
                
                He was pursuing B.A. examination when his parents planned to have him married. He vehemently rejected the suggestion and said that, if his marriage was to take place in Slave-India, my bride shall be only death.&quot; Singh later joined the Hindustan Republican Association, a radical group, later known as the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association. He returned to his home in Lahore after assurances from his parents that he would not be compelled to get married. He established contact with the members of the Kirti Kisan Party and started contributing regularly to its magazine, the &quot;Kirti&quot;. In March 1926, the Naujawan Bharat Sabha was formed with Bhagat Singh, as its secretary.
                
                
                
                On 30 October 1928, an all-parties procession, led by Lala Lajpat Rai, marched towards the Lahore railway station to protest against the arrival of the Simon Commission. Stopping the procession, police made a lathi charge at the activists. The confrontation left Lala Lajpat Rai with severe injuries and also led to his death. As an avenge to the death of Lala Lajpat Rai, Bhagat Singh and his associates plotted the assassination of Scott, the Superintendent of Police, believed to have ordered the lathi charge. The revolutionaries, mistaking J.P. Saunders, an Assistant Superintendent of Police, as Scott, killed him instead. Bhagat Singh quickly left Lahore to escape his arrest. To avoid recognition, he shaved his beard and cut his hair, a violation of the sacred tenets of Sikhism.</string>

			<string>Chandra Shekhar Azad</string>
			<key>description</key>
			<string>Chandrashekhar Azad was a great Indian freedom fighter. His fierce patriotism and courage inspired others of his generation to enter freedom struggle. Chandrasekhar Azad was the mentor Bhagat Singh, another great freedom fighter, and along with Bhagat Singh he is considered as one of the greatest revolutionaries that India has produced. Chandra Shekhar Azad was born on July 23,1906 in Badarka village of Unnao district in Uttar Pradesh. His parents were Pandit Sitaram Tiwari and Jagarani Devi.Pandit Sitaram Tiwari was serving in erstwhile estate of Alirajpur (situated in present day Madhya Pradesh) and Chandra Shekhar Azad&apos;s childhood was spent in the village Bhabra .
                
                On the insistence of her mother Jagrani Devi, Chandra Shekhar Azad went to Kashi Vidyapeeth, Benaras for studying Sanskrit. Chandrashekhar Azad was deeply troubled by the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre in Amritsar in 1919. In 1921, when Mahatma Gandhi launched Non-Cooperation movement, Chandrasekhar Azad actively participated in revolutionary activities. He received his first punishment at the age of fifteen. Chandra Shekhar was caught while indulging in revolutionary activities. When the magistrate asked him his name, he said &quot;Azad&quot; (meaning free). Chandrashekhar Azad was sentenced to fifteen lashes. With each stroke of the whip the young Chandrasekhar shouted &quot;Bart Mata Kid Jai&quot;. From then on Chandrashekhar assumed the title of Azad and came to known as Chandrashekhar Azad. Chandrashekhar Azad vowed that he would never be arrested by the British police and would die as free man. After the suspension of non-cooperation movement Chandrashekhar Azad was attracted towards more aggressive and revolutionary ideals.
                
                
                He committed himself to complete independence by any means. Chandrashekhar Azad and his compatriots would target British officials known for their oppressive actions against ordinary people and freedom fighters. Chandrashekhar Azad was involved in Kakori Train Robbery (1926), the attempt to blow up the Viceroy&apos;s train (1926), and the shooting of Saunders at Lahore (1928) to avenge the killing of Lala Lajpatrai. Along with Bhagat Singh and other compatriots like Sukhdev and Rajguru, Chandrashekhar Azad formed the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HRSA). HRSA was committed to complete Indian independence and socialist principles for India&apos;s future progress. Chandrashekhar Azad was a terror for British police. He was on their hit list and the British police badly wanted to capture him dead or alive. On February 27, 1931 Chandrashekhar Azad met two of his comrades at the Alfred Park Allah bad.
                
                
                He was betrayed by an informer who had informed the British police. The police surrounded the park and ordered Chandrashekhar Azad to surrender. Chandrashekhar Azad fought alone valiantly and killed three policemen. But finding himself surrounded and seeing no route for escape, Chandrashekhar Azad shot himself. Thus he kept his pledge of not being caught alive.Read more at http://www.iloveindia.com/indian-heroes/chandrashekhar-azad.html#PVj38srRjmH5P9Pt.99 </string>

			<string>Amitabh Bachchan</string>
			<key>description</key>
			<string>Amitabh Bachchan was born to Harivansh Rai Bachchan, a well known Hindi poet and Teji Bachchan in the year 1942. He got married to actress Jaya Bhaduri on June 3, 1973 and has two children, actor Abhishek Bachchan and Shweta Nanda.He first gained popularity in the early 1970s as the &quot;angry young man&quot; of Hindi cinema, and has since appeared in over 180 Indian films in a career spanning more than four decades. Amitabh Bachchan is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential actors in the history of Indian cinema.Big B has won numerous major awards in his career, including four National Film Awards, three of which are in the Best Actor category, and fourteen Filmfare Awards. He is the most-nominated performer in any major acting category at Filmfare, with 37 nominations overall.In addition to acting, Bachchan has worked as a playback singer, film producer and television presenter. He also had a stint in politics in the 1980s. He has received both the Padma Shri and the Padma Bhushan civilian awards from the Indian government.The actor has a double MA from Allahabad’s Prabodhini and Nainital’s Sherwood College. He also has a science degree from Kirori Mal College. In 1969, he made his debut with the film Saat Hindustani. He won the National Award for this film as Best Newcomer.
                
                
                In 2000 and 2005, he hosted the famous game show Kaun Banega crorepati.Bachchan has been nominated for the Filmfare Best Actor award, twenty-eight times (a record) and as Filmfare Best Supporting Actor nine times, (also a record).He has been nominated three times as Filmfare best playback singer.In 2007, Amitabh Bachchan received the Forever Indian award by the Diamond Trading Company. He is the first Indian to receive this award.He has also recently been honoured with Wold Economic Forum&apos;s Crystal Award for his contribution to world cinema.On 26 July 1982, while filming Coolie in the University Campus in Bangalore, Bachchan suffered a near fatal intestinal injury during the filming of a fight scene with co-actor Puneet Issar. The corner of the table struck his abdomen, resulting in a splenic rupture from which he lost a significant amount of blood. He required an emergency splenectomy and remained critically ill in hospital for many months, at times close to death.The public response included prayers in temples and offers to sacrifice limbs to save him, while later, there were long queues of well-wishing fans outside the hospital where he was recuperating.Nevertheless, he spent many months recovering and resumed filming later that year after a long period of recuperation.The film was released in 1983, and partly due to the huge publicity of Bachchan&apos;s accident, the film was a box office success.The director, Manmohan Desai, altered the ending of Coolie after Bachchan&apos;s accident. Bachchan&apos;s character was originally intended to have been killed off but after the change of script, the character lived in the end.
                
                
                It would have been inappropriate, said Desai, for the man who had just fended off death in real life to be killed on screen. Also, in the released film the footage of the fight scene is frozen at the critical moment, and a caption appears onscreen marking this as the instant of the actor&apos;s injury and the ensuing publicity of the accident. In 2000, Amitabh Bachchan appeared in Yash Chopra&apos;s box-office hit, Mohabbatein, directed by Aditya Chopra. Other hits followed, with Bachchan appearing as an older family patriarch in Ek Rishtaa: The Bond of Love (2001), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001) and Baghban (2003). As an actor, he continued to perform in a range of characters, receiving critical praise for his performances in Aks (2001), Aankhen (2002), Khakee (2004) and Dev (2004). One project that did particularly well for Bachchan was Sanjay Leela Bhansali&apos;s Black (2005). His performance was unanimously praised by critics and audiences and won him his second National Film Award for Best Actor and fourth Filmfare Best Actor Award. Taking advantage of this resurgence, Amitabh began endorsing a variety of products and services, appearing in many television and billboard advertisements. In 2005 and 2006, he starred with his son Abhishek in the hit films Bunty Aur Babli (2005), the Godfather tribute Sarkar (2005), and Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna (2006). All of them were successful at the box office. His later releases in 2006 and early 2007 were Baabul (2006),Ekalavya and Nishabd (2007), which failed to do well at the box office but his performances in each of them were praised by critics. Bachchan is known for his deep, baritone voice. He has been a narrator, a playback singer and presenter for numerous programmes. Renowned film director Satyajit Ray was so impressed with Bachchan&apos;s voice, that he decided to use his voice as commentary in Shatranj Ke Khilari since he could not find a suitable role for him. In 2005, Bachchan has lent his voice to the Oscar-winning French documentary March of the Penguins, directed by Luc Jacquet. Severals books have been written about Bachchan.

			<string>Mahatma Gandhi</string>
			<key>description</key>
			<string>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi(Hindustani): 2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was the preeminent leader of the Indian independence movement in British-ruled India. Employing nonviolent civil disobedience, Gandhi led India to independence and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahatma (Sanskrit: &quot;high-souled&quot;, &quot;venerable&quot;) applied to him first in 1914 in South Africa, is now used worldwide. He is also called Bapu (Gujarati: endearment for &quot;father&quot;, &quot;papa&quot;) in India. In common parlance in India he is often called Gandhiji. He is unofficially called the Father of the Nation.

Born and raised in a Hindu merchant caste family in coastal Gujarat, western India, and trained in law at the Inner Temple, London, Gandhi first employed nonviolent civil disobedience as an expatriate lawyer in South Africa, in the resident Indian community&apos;s struggle for civil rights. After his return to India in 1915, he set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination. Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women&apos;s rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, but above all for achieving Swaraj or self-rule.</string>

			<string>Rabindranath Tagore</string>
			<key>description</key>
			<string>Rabindranath Tagore (Bengali) also written Ravīndranātha Thākura (7 May 1861 – 7 August 1941),sobriquet Gurudev, was a Bengali polymath who reshaped Bengali literature and music, as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author of Gitanjali and its &quot;profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse&quot;, he became the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913. In translation his poetry was viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however, his &quot;elegant prose and magical poetry&quot; remain largely unknown outside Bengal. Sometimes referred to as &quot;the Bard of Bengal&quot;. 

A Pirali Brahmin from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Jessore, Tagore wrote poetry as an eight-year-old. At the age of sixteen, he released his first substantial poems under the pseudonym Bhānusiṃha (&quot;Sun Lion&quot;), which were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics.  By 1877 he graduated to his first short stories and dramas, published under his real name. As a humanist, universalist internationalist, and ardent anti-nationalist, he denounced the British Raj and advocated independence from Britain. As an exponent of the Bengal Renaissance, he advanced a vast canon that comprised paintings, sketches and doodles, hundreds of texts, and some two thousand songs; his legacy endures also in the institution he founded, Visva-Bharati University.

			<string>Swami Vivekananda</string>
			<key>description</key>
			<string>Swami Vivekananda (Bengali: স্বামী বিবেকানন্দ 12 January 1863 – 4 July 1902), born Narendranath Datta, was an Indian Hindu monk, a chief disciple of the 19th-century Indian mystic Ramakrishna. He was a key figure in the introduction of the Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world and is credited with raising interfaith awareness, bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion during the late 19th century. He was a major force in the revival of Hinduism in India, and contributed to the concept of nationalism in colonial India. Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission. He is perhaps best known for his speech which began, &quot;Sisters and brothers of America ...,&quot; in which he introduced Hinduism at the Parliament of the World&apos;s Religions in Chicago in 1893.

Born into an aristocratic Bengali family of Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined towards spirituality. He was influenced by his Guru, Ramakrishna Deva, from whom he learnt that all living beings were an embodiment of the divine self, therefore, service to God could be rendered by service to mankind. After Ramakrishna&apos;s death, Vivekananda toured the Indian subcontinent extensively and acquired first-hand knowledge of the conditions prevailing in British India. He later travelled to the United States, representing India at the 1893 Parliament of the World Religions. Vivekananda conducted hundreds of public and private lectures and classes, disseminating tenets of Hindu philosophy in the United States, England and Europe. In India, Vivekananda is regarded as a patriotic saint and his birthday is celebrated there as National Youth Day.</string>

			<string>Subhas Chandra Bose (23 January 1897 – 18 August 1945), was an Indian nationalist whose defiant patriotism made him a hero in India, but whose attempt during World War II to rid India of British rule with the help of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan left a troubled legacy. The honorific Netaji (Hindustani: &quot;Respected Leader&quot;), first applied in early 1942 to Bose in Germany by the Indian soldiers of the Indische Legion and by the German and Indian officials in the Special Bureau for India in Berlin, was later used throughout India. 
Earlier, Bose had been a leader of the younger, radical, wing of the Indian National Congress in the late 1920s and 1930s, rising to become Congress President in 1938 and 1939.  However, he was ousted from Congress leadership positions in 1939 following differences with Mahatma Gandhi and the Congress high command. He was subsequently placed under house arrest by the British before escaping from India in 1940. </string>

Ramakrishna was given to spiritual ecstacies from a young age, and was influenced by several religious traditions, including devotion toward the goddess Kali, Tantra and Vaishnava bhakti, and Advaita Vedanta.
Admiration for him amongst Bengali elites led to the formation of the Ramakrishna Mission by his chief disciple Swami Vivekananda, which acquired worldwide influence in the spread of modern Hinduism.

			<string>C. V. Raman</string>
			<key>description</key>
			<string>Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman  (7 November 1888 – 21 November 1970) was an Indian physicist born in the former Madras Province in India, who carried out ground-breaking work in the field of light scattering, which earned him the 1930 Nobel Prize for Physics. He discovered that when light traverses a transparent material, some of the deflected light changes in wavelength. This phenomenon, subsequently known as Raman scattering, results from the Raman effect. In 1954 India honoured him with its highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna.

Raman&apos;s father initially taught in a school in Thiruvanaikaval, became a lecturer of mathematics and physics in Mrs. A.V. Narasimha Rao College,Vishakapatnam (then Vishakapatnam) in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, and later joined Presidency College in Madras (now Chennai).

			<key>description</key>
			<string>Srinivasa Ramanujan FRS  (22 December 1887 – 26 April 1920) was an Indian mathematician and autodidact. Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made extraordinary contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions. Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation; it was quickly recognised by Indian mathematicians. When his skills became obvious and known to the wider mathematical community, centred in Europe at the time, he began a famous partnership with the English mathematician G. H. Hardy. The Cambridge professor realised that Ramanujan had rediscovered previously known theorems in addition to producing new ones.

During his short life, Ramanujan independently compiled nearly 3,900 results (mostly identities and equations). Nearly all his claims have now been proven correct, although some were already known.  His original and highly unconventional results, such as the Ramanujan prime and the Ramanujan theta function, have inspired a vast amount of further research. The Ramanujan Journal, an international publication, was launched to publish work in all areas of mathematics influenced by his work.

Of notably deep religious conviction, Ramanujan credited his substantial mathematical capacities to divinity: &apos;&quot;An equation for me has no meaning,&quot; he once said, &quot;unless it expresses a thought of God.&quot;&apos;

			<string>Ravi Shankar</string>
			<key>description</key>
			<string>Ravi Shankar, (7 April 1920 – 11 December 2012), born Rabindra Shankar Chowdhury,  his name often preceded by the title Pandit (&apos;Master&apos;), was a world-famous Indian musician and a composer of Hindustani classical music. He was one of the best-known exponents of the sitar in the second half of the 20th century and influenced many other musicians throughout the world.
Shankar was born to a Bengali family in India, and spent his youth touring India and Europe with the dance group of his brother Uday Shankar. He gave up dancing in 1938 to study sitar playing under court musician Allauddin Khan. After finishing his studies in 1944, Shankar worked as a composer, creating the music for the Apu Trilogy by Satyajit Ray, and was music director of All India Radio, New Delhi, from 1949 to 1956.
In 1956 he began to tour Europe and the Americas playing Indian classical music and increased its popularity there in the 1960s through teaching, performance, and his association with violinist Yehudi Menuhin and Beatles guitarist George Harrison. His influence on the latter helped popularise the use of Indian instruments in pop music throughout the 1960s. Shankar engaged Western music by writing compositions for sitar and orchestra, and toured the world in the 1970s and 1980s. From 1986 to 1992, he served as a nominated member of Rajya Sabha, the upper chamber of the Parliament of India. He continued to perform until the end of his life. In 1999, Shankar was awarded India&apos;s highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna.
