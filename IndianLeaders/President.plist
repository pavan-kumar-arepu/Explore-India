He was the first member of the country’s lowest social caste, the group traditionally considered to be untouchable, to occupy the office.
                
                
Despite his family’s poverty and social status, Narayanan’s intellect won him a government-sponsored scholarship. After graduating from the  the University of Kerala, he worked as a journalist for the Hindu(1944–45) and the Times of India (1945). He soon won another scholarship and left India to attend the London School of Economics, where he received top academic honours. While in England Narayanan also served as a foreign correspondent for Social Welfare Weekly.


Narayanan returned to India in 1948 and soon after entered the foreign Services, despite opposition from upper-caste officials. During a long and distinguished career as a diplomat (1949–83), he held posts in numerous countries but was especially effective while serving in China (1976–78), where he helped mend relations following a 15-year rift. He was also ambassador to the United States (1980–83) at a time of strained relations between the two countries. In 1979 Narayanan was named vice-chancellor of JawaharLal NehruUniversity. An intellectual and a scholar, Narayanan was the author or coauthor of several works on Indian politics and international relations, notably India and America: Essays in Understanding (1984) and Non-Alignment in Contemporary International Relations (1981).


In 1984 Narayanan became active in politics. He served in parliament as a cabinet minister and in 1992 was named vice president, a post he held for five years. In 1997 he was elected president of India, winning 95 percent of the votes of mainly upper-caste lawmakers.

			<key>descrpition</key>
			<string>Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma was the ninth President of India, serving from 1992 to 1997. But his contribution to India has been much more than that. He was a scholar, holding an extraordinary portfolio of educational qualifications. He was also a journalist and wrote on diverse topics, from history to literature, philosophy to comparative religions, and many more articles. Additionally, he was also a renowned freedom fighter, actively involved in the Indian Freedom Movement and took part in various campaigns. Furthermore, he was a dedicated politician, handled many portfolios including education, law, public works etc and held many high positions in Indian politics before he was made the President. The respect he had earned during his lifetime rightly got him many honors and honorable positions. The following part will throw more light on the life and political career of Dr Shankar Dayal Sharma and on the honors that he received.
                
                Sharma&apos;s political career started during the 1940s when he patriotically involved himself in the Indian freedom movement by participating in the historic Quit India Movement of 1942, initiated because of Mahatma Gandhi&apos;s call for immediate independence. It was around the same time when he joined the Indian National Congress, a party under which he fought and was elected many times at numerous positions and remained faithful to it till the very end. It was from 1950 to 1952 that he served as the president of the Bhopal Congress Committee and in the very same year was made the Chief Minister of Bhopal, where he served till the year 1956. It was as the Chief Minister of Bhopal that he put all his efforts to abolish the the jagirdar system prevalent in India. From the year 1956 to 1971, he remained a member of the Madhya Pradesh legislative assembly. All in between the years he supported Indira Gandhi&apos;s efforts to gain leadership of the congress party. In 1959, when UNESCO conference for the primary and secondary education was held at Karachi, he was the leader of the Indian Delegation. With short stints in quick successions, from being the President of the Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee to being the General Secretary of the Indian National Congress and by further serving as the President of the Indian National Congress; it was finally in the year 1974 that he was made the Union Minister for Communications under the leadership of Indira Gandhi and served till 1977.
                
                Again, with short stints as the Governor of Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, and Maharashtra in 1984, 1985, and 1986 respectively; Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma proved his credentials as a qualified politician and a leader. In the year 1987, he became the eighth Vice President of India and was also made the Chairman of Rajya Sabha. He served as the Vice President of India for a five-year long term till 1992, when he took over the proceedings from Ramaswamy Venkataraman and was made the ninth President of India. During his stay as the President of India, it was his responsibility to swear in three Prime Ministers and was actively involved in the ceremonial matters. However, because of poor health, he not run for the next term of Presidency.</string>

			<key>descrpition</key>
			<string>When Ramaswamy Venkataraman passed away, the Government of India declared a seven day state of mourning, a fitting tribute to a man who had spent his entire life in the service of the nation and its people. A true patriot, Venkataraman had the distinguished record of leading any post or organization that he was heading from strength to strength. And in his sparkling career he led many institutions with the wisdom and charisma of a true statesman.
                
                Be it defending Indians detained in Malaya and Singapore or presiding over the turmoil of coalition politics when he was the President of India, a period which saw three Prime Ministers in two years, he essayed each role with a felicity keeping only the national interest in mind. Venkataraman was perhaps the last of the ideal public servants who was noted for his work, integrity and commitment, rather than rhetoric and sycophancy that characterizes most of the so-called statesmen nowadays. A strict follower of the Nehru-Gandhi tradition, his life and work is a statement of the fact that he didn’t bring any blemish to the two greatest statesmen ever. Because of his labor activism and skill as a lawyer, it was only natural that Venkataraman found himself drifting into politics at a time when the newly independent nation of India required visionaries to curve its identity. Venkataraman became a member of the Constituent Assembly, which drafted the Constitution of India.
                
                The 50’s saw fervent political activity when he was elected to the Provincial Parliament serving till 1952, when he was elected to the first Parliament in which he served till 1957. In the same year, he was re-elected to the Parliament, but resigned from his seat to join the Chennai State Government as a Minister of Labor, Cooperation, Industries, Power, Transport and Commercial Taxes, on the invitation of K. Kamraj, and held the post till 1957. From 1953 to 1954, Venkataraman worked as the Secretary to the Congress Parliament Party. In 1952, he was also sent as workers’ delegate to attend the Session of the Metal Trades Committee of International Labor Organization and went to New Zealand as a member of the Indian Parliamentary Delegation to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference. During this time, Venkataraman also led the Madras Legislative Council. In 1967, Venkataraman was entrusted with the portfolio of Industry, Labor, Power, Transport, Communications, and Railways as a member of the Union Planning Commission and held the position until 1971. From 1975 to 1977, Venkataraman edited the magazine &apos;Swarajya&apos; while pursuing his political activity.
                
                At various times, he served as a member of the Political Affairs Committee and the Economic Affairs Committee of the union cabinet. Venkataraman was elected to the Lok Sabha in 1977 from the south Madras constituency and served as a Member of Parliament in the Opposition. At the same time, he was also the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee.  Venkataraman re-entered the national political scene in 1980 when he was re-elected to the Lok Sabha and was made the Finance Minister in the Indira Gandhi government. Later, he was appointed the Defence Minister in 1983. Venkataraman initiated a radical change in India’s missile programme by consolidating the entire missile system into Integrated Guided Missile Development Program. It was Venkataraman who transferred APJ Abdul Kalam to the missile programme from the space programme, who was later known as the &apos;Missile Man of India’ for leading the ballistic missile and space rocket technology. Venkataraman was, then, made the Vice President of India in 1984, and later in July 1987 he was sworn in as the President of India serving till 1992.  During his tenure, Venkataraman had the distinction of working with four Prime Ministers among which he himself had appointed three of them. It was also during his tenure that saw the advent of coalition politics.</string>

			<string>Giani Zail Singh</string>
			<key>tenure</key>
			<string>25 July 1982 - 25 July 1987</string>
			<key>descrpition</key>
			<string>Giani zail singh was first punjabi to become president of India. Born on 5 May 1916, son of Mata Ind Kaur and Bhai Kishan Singh in a small village named Sandhwan, near Kot Kapura, formerly prince state of Faridkot. Kishen Singh was village carpenter. He also had some land to till. He was devout Sikh and was known in the countryside for his simple and upright manner. Zail Singh was youngest of Five brothers and sisters. Zail Singh lost his mother at his early age. He was brought up by the sister of his mother named Daya Kaur. He had little formal education.  He acquired a fairly wide knowledge of Sikh doctrine and history. He was accepted for admission to the Shahid Sikh Missionary college at Amritsar, without fullfilling the miminum entry condition of marticulation. What immpressed authorities was his flair for public speaking.
                
                
After this course, Giani was attached to his name., which meant &quot;the one learned in the religious lore&quot;. This epithet was stuck to his name for rest of the life. He grew into the mastery of public speaking and could easily throw spells on his audiences. He could mix with uncanny facility couplets of Urdu verse with his fluent Punjabi. He had a subtle sense of fun.


His native Faridkot was small unit politically and geographically., peaceful and quiet. It ruler, Raja Harinder Singh was a colorful personality. He was full of energy and ambition. One of his aims was to open the doors of modern progress for his state and have it counted among the more progressive territories of the region. Because of Raja&apos;s friendly nature he knew almost two three families of all the villages of his territories. Raja was an easy mixer with common folks. In the year of Indian Independence, 1947 Nehru came to Faridkot asking Raja to align himself with India. Nehru encouraged the local extremsits. When Raja was away in Malerkotla they formed a parallel government. Raja was in a rage. He immediately put an end to revolt and send out a very angry cable to Nehru and Patel, two indian leaders who were negotiating with the Indian Princes. Since Zail Singh was aligned with the people who were protesting against the Raja, he had to bear the Raja&apos;s brunt.


After india was divided into Muslim Pakistan and Secular India, East Punjab&apos;s small kingdoms were made into a state called PEPSU short for Patiala and East Punjab States Union, that was conglomerate of Patiala,Jind, Nabha, Kapurthala and Faridkot states. This new state had total area of 10,090 Sq Miles with population being 34,24,060. The annual revenue of the state was little over 5 crores.


Giani Zail singh had emerged from one of the smaller units. He was dedicated and single minded with limitless powers of concentration. In 1949, a non party government was established in PEPSU with Gian Singh Rarewala of Patiala as Chief Minister and Giani Zail Singh as Revenue minister. Then after the elections in 1951, in the congress government formed on 23 May 1951, he became Agriculture minister. From 1956 to 1962 he served as a Member of Indian parliament (Rajya Sabha). In general elections in 1972, he became chief minister of Punjab. In the 1980 General elections Giani Zail singh was elected as Member of Parliament of Lok Sabha, Indira Gandhi the president of the Congress party made him minister of home affairs. In 1982 Giani Zail Singh was unaanimously elected by the congress party as a choice for President. Giani Zail Singh won almost by a unianomous vote of the nation. Even the dissident parties such as Akalis and Communists supported him.</string>

			<string>Shri Neelam Sanjiva Reddy was born on May 18, 1913 and died on June 1, 1996.
SHRI NEELAM SANJIVA REDDY, the sixth President of India, was a veteran statesman and administrator. He held many eminent positions in public life both before and after independence. Born in a peasant family at Illuri village in the Anantapur District (Andhra Pradesh) on May 19, 1913, Shri Sanjiva Reddy had his early education at the Theosophical High School at Adyar in Madras and later joined the Arts College at Anantapur.


In 1931, the young Sanjiva Reddy gave up his studies to take part in the freedom movement. His student days were marked by Youth League and other nationalist activities. In fact, he first came into limelight when he participated in a student satyagraha.


At the age of 25, Shri Reddy was elected Secretary of the Andhra Pradesh Provincial Congress Committee and remained in that office for 10 years. He was in prison for a greater part of the period 1940-1945. In March 1942,he was released for a while but in August, the same year he was re-arrested and kept in Amraoti jail in Madhya Pradesh along with Shri Prakasam, Shri Satyamurti, Shri Kamaraj, Shri Giri and others till 1945.


In 1946, Shri Reddy was elected to the Madras Legislaltive Assembly and became the Secretary of the Madras Congress Legislature Party the following year. In 1947, he became a Member of the Indian Constitutent Assembly.
From April 1949 to April 1951, he was Minister for Prohibition, Housing and Forests in the composite state of Madras. In 1951, he resigned this office to contest the Election for the Presidentship of the Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee which he won. It was during this period that Shri Reddy suffered a terrible tragedy in the death of his five year old son in a motor accident. This shocked him so deeply that he resigned the APCC Presidentship. Later, however, he was prevailed upon to withdraw his resignation.


In 1952, he was elected Member of the Rajya Sabha. In 1953, he accepted the post of Deputy Chief Minister in the Cabinet of the late Shri T. Prakasam, even though he was elected the Leader of the Congress Legislature Party. He was again elected to the Legislative Assembly in 1955 and became Deputy Chief Minister in Shri B. Gopala Reddi&apos;s cabinet.


Shri Reddy became the first Chief Minister to the new State of Andhra Pradesh which was formed following the reorganization of the States in October, 1956. In 1959, he resigned the Chief Ministership to take over the Presidentship of the Indian National Congress. On the expiry of his term of office in March, 1962, he again became the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. In February 1964, he voluntarily resigned the office of Chief Minister in order to set high standards of public life. He was, however, re-elected as the leader of the Congress Legislature Party but he recommended to the Governor to invite Shri K. Brahmananda Reddy, a colleague of his to form a new Ministry.


On June 9, 1964, Shri Reddy was appointed a Member of the Union Cabinet formed by Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri and took over the portfolio of Steel and Mines. He was elected to the Rajya Sabha in November, 1964.
Shri Reddy was Union Minister of Transport, Civil Aviation, Shipping and Tourism from January 1966 to March 1967 in the Cabinet formed by Shrimati Indira Gandhi. In the General Elections in 1967, he was returned to the Lok Sabha from Hindupur constituency in Andhra Pradesh. He was elected Speaker of the Lok Sabha on March 17, 1967, an office that won him unprecedented acclaim and admiration.


Shri Reddy resigned the Speakership of the Lok Sabha on the 19th July, 1969 to contest the Presidential election on the basis of his nomination as a nominee of the Congress filed by Shrimati Indira Gandhi. It is now common knowledge that after filing this nomination Shrimati Indira Gandhi subsequently organized his defeat in the elections by unethical means.


After 1969, Shri Reddy devoted his time to agriculture, which has always remained his first love. However, on May 1, 1975 he entered active politics again by addressing a public meeting at Hyderabad along with Shri Jayaprakash Narain. In March 1977, he fought the Lok Sabha election from Nandyal constituency in Andhra Pradesh as a Janata Party candidate. He was the only non-Congress candidate to get elected from Andhra Pradesh.


Shri Reddy was unanimously elected Speaker of the Lok Sabha on March 26, 1977. He relinquished this office on July 13, 1977 to file his nomination for the Presidentship of the Indian Union. He was unanimously sponsored as the consensus candidate for the Presidentship by all political parties, a rare even in recent political history. He was declared elected unopposed on July 21, 1977.
The degree of Honorary Doctor of Laws was conferred on Shri Sanjiva Reddy by the Sri Venkateshwara University in 1958.
Shri Sanjiva Reddy married Shrimati Nagarathnamma on June 8, 1935 and they had one son and three daughters.</string>

			<string>Regarded as one of the greatest sons of Assam and India, Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed was a highly successful political leader who left a permanent imprint on the political landscape of India, leaving every citizen immensely inspired till date. Such was the impact of this eminent leader&apos;s long and distinguished career who made priceless contributions towards the Indian independence movement. Further, by occupying the position of the President of India is just one shining example of his commitment towards the selfless service and ethical values bestowed upon the nation and its people. Under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, this prominent leader grew to lead the nation with undying love, passion, and determination.During his stay in England, Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed met Jawaharlal Nehru in 1925 whose progressive ideas touched him so much that he treated him as his mentor and friend from 1930s onwards.
                
                On Nehru&apos;s request, Ali Ahmed joined the Indian National Congress and actively participated in the Indian freedom struggle, though he was persuaded by his co-religionists to join the Muslim League. He offered Satyagraha in 1940 for which he was arrested and imprisoned. Further in 1942, he supported the Quit India Movement for which he was yet again arrested in August 9, while returning from the historic session of All India Congress Committee (AICC) meeting in Bombay. He was, thus, detained as a security prisoner for three and a half years until April 1945. While serving as a Congress leader, Ali Ahmed occupied several positions.
                
                To begin with, he was a member of Assam Pradesh Congress Committee since 1936 and was elected to Assam Assembly in 1935. Later, he became the Minister of Finance, Revenue, and Labor in September 1938. During his term at the Ministerial office, Ali Ahmed gave a proof of his administrative abilities. He introduced the Assam Agricultural Income Tax Bill, the first of its kind in India, which levied taxes on tea garden lands in the Province and his pro-labor policy in the labor strike in the British-owned Assam Oil Company Ltd.

			<string>In 1954, Varahagiri Venkata Giri did not hesitate to resign from his position as Minister for Labour, in the cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru, over the bank award issue. Another trait of his character was un­daunted courage.

While in London, along with his father he made representations to the Secretary of State for India for the immediate formation of Andhra province and also opposed the transfer of Berhampore, Parlakimedi, Jeypore and other areas to the proposed Orissa province.


In 1936, when elections were held under the Government of India Act he contested the Madras Legislative Assembly from Bobbili as the Congress candidate. His opponent was the Rajah of Bobbili, the Premier of Madras and the Leader of the Justice Party. It will not be out of place to mention here that in this election Pandit Nehru was not allowed to address an election meeting of the Congress Party at Bobbili town. In spite of all these obstacles, Girl won the election with a thumping majority.
When the Congress formed the ministry under C. Rajagopalachari, Giri became Minister for Labor and Industries.
During the Quit India Movement, Giri was detained from August 1942 to 1946 in different prisons at Vellore, Nagpur etc.


He was again elected to the Madras Legislative Assembly in the elections of 1946 and was Minister for Labor in the Cabinet of Prakasam. From 1947 to 1951 he was High Commissioner for India in Ceylon Sri Lanka.
In the first General Elections of 1952, he was returned to the Lok Sabha from the Pathapatnam constituency of Srikakulam district. In 1952 he became Union Minister for Labor. As already mentioned he resigned from his position in 1954.


Before becoming the President of India in 1969, he served with distinc­tion as the Governor of Uttar Pradesh, Kerala and Mysore Karnataka. He was the Vice-President of India during the years 1967-69.

			<string>Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was first Vice President of India and second President of India. He was also a philosopher and introduced the thinking of western idealist philosophers into Indian thought. He was a famous teacher and his birthday is celebrated as Teacher&apos;s Day in India. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was born on September 5, 1888 at Tirutani, Madras in a poor Brahmin family. As his father was poor Radhakrishnan supported most of his education through scholarships. Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan had his early education at Gowdie School, Tiruvallur and then went to the Lutheran Mission School in Tirupati for his high school.
                
                He joined the Voorhee&apos;s College in Vellore and later switched to the Madras Christian College. He chose Philosophy as his major subject and did his B.A. and M.A. in it. After completing his M.A., Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, accepted an Assistant Lectureship at the Madras Presidency College in 1909. In college, he mastered the classics of Hindu philosophy, namely the Upanishads, Bhagvad Gita, Brahmasutra, and commentaries of Sankara, Ramunuja and Madhava. He also acquainted himself with Buddhist and Jain philosophy and philosophies of Western thinkers such as Plato, Plotinus, Kant, Bradley, and Bergson. In 1918, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was selected as Professor of Philosophy by the University of Mysore. In 1921, Radhakrishnan was nominated as Professor of Philosophy at the Calcutta University, 1921. In 1923, Dr. Radhakrishnan&apos;s book &quot;Indian Philosophy&quot; was published.
                
                
                The book was hailed as a &quot;philosophical classic and a literary masterpiece.&quot; Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was called to Oxford University, to deliver lectures on Hindu philosophy. He used his lectures as a platform to further India&apos;s cause for freedom. He also argued that Western philosophers, despite all claims to objectivity, were biased by theological influences from their wider culture. He showed that Indian philosophy, once translated into standard academic jargon, is worthy of being called philosophy by Western standards. He thus placed Indian Philosophy on world map. In 1931, Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was elected Vice Chancellor of the Andhra University. In 1939, Radhakrishnan became the Vice Chancellor of the Benaras Hindu University. In 1946, he was appointed as Ambassador to UNESCO. After Independence Dr. Radhakrishnan was requested to Chair the University Education Commission in 1948. The Radhakrishnan Committee&apos;s suggestions helped mould the education system for India&apos;s needs.</string>

			<string>Rajendra Prasad</string>
			<key>tenure</key>
			<string>26 January 1950 - 12 May 1962</string>
			<key>descrpition</key>
			<string>Dr. Rajendra Prasad was the first President of independent India. He was the President of the Constituent Assembly that drafted the Constitution. He had also served as a Cabinet Minister briefly in the first Government of independent India. Dr. Rajendra Prasad was one of the foremost disciples of Gandhiji and he played a crucial role in Indian freedom struggle.
                

Dr. Rajendra Prasad was born on December 3, 1884 in Ziradei village in Siwan district of Bihar. His father&apos;s name was Mahadev Sahay and his mother&apos;s name was Kamleshwari Devi. Rajendra Prasad was youngest among his siblings. Mahadev Sahay was a Persian and Sanskrit language scholar. Dr. Rajendra Prasad was greatly attached to his mother and elder brother Mahendra.

At the age of five Rajendra Prasad was, according to the practice in the community to which he belonged, put under a Maulavi who taught him Persian. Later, he was taught Hindi and arithmetic. At the age of 12, Rajendra Prasad was married to Rajvanshi Devi.



Dr. Rajendra Prasad was a brilliant student. He stood first in the entrance examination to the University of Calcutta, and was awarded a monthly scholarship of Rs.30. He joined the famous Calcutta Presidency College in 1902. Here his teachers included the great scientist Jagdish Chandra Bose and the highly respected Prafulla Chandra Roy. Later on he switched from Science to Arts and completed his M.A. and Masters in Law. Meanwhile, in 1905, Doctor, Rajendra Prasad was initiated into the Swadeshi Movement by his elder brother Mahendra. He also joined the Dawn Society run by Satish Chandra Mukherjee, and Sister Nivedita.



The arrival of Mahatma Gandhi on the Indian national scene greatly influenced Dr. Rajendra Prasad. While Gandhiji was on a fact-finding mission in Champaran district of Bihar, he called on Rajendra Prasad to come to Champaran with volunteers. Dr. Rajendra Prasad was greatly impressed by the dedication, conviction and courage that Gandhiji displayed. Gandhiji&apos;s influence greatly altered Dr. Rajendra Prasad&apos;s outlook. He sought ways to simplify his life and reduced the number of servants he had to one. He started doing his daily chores such as sweeping the floor, washing the utensils-the tasks he had all along assumed others would do for him.



After coming into contact with Gandhiji, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, immersed himself fully into the freedom struggle. He played a active role during Non-Cooperation Movement. Dr. Rajendra Prasad was arrested in 1930 while participating in Salt Satyagraha. He was in jail when on 15 January 1934 a devastating earthquake struck Bihar. Rajendra Prasad was released from the jail two days later and he immediately set himself for the task of raising funds and organizing relief. The Viceroy also raised a fund for the purpose. However, while Rajendra Prasad&apos;s fund collected over Rs.3.8million, the Viceroy could only manage one-third of that amount. The way the relief was organized, it amply demonstrated the administrative acumen of Dr. Rajendra Prasad. Soon after this Dr Rajendra Prasad was elected as the President of the Bombay session of the Indian National Congress. He was elected as Congress President again in 1939 in the following the resignation of Netaji Subash Chandra Bose.



In July 1946, when the Constituent Assembly was established to frame the Constitution of India, Dr. Rajendra Prasad was elected its President. Two and a half years after independence, on January 26, 1950, the Constitution of independent India was ratified and Dr. Rajendra Prasad was elected as India&apos;s first President. As a President, he used his moderating influence silently and unobtrusively and set a healthy precedent for others to follow. During his tenure as President he visited many countries on missions of goodwill and sought to establish and nourish new relationships.

In 1962, after 12 years as President, Dr. Rajendra Prasad retired, and was subsequently awarded the Desh Ratna, the nation&apos;s highest civilian award. He spent the last few months of his life in retirement at the Sadaqat Ashram in Patna. Dr. Rajendra Prasad died on February 28, 1963.</string>
